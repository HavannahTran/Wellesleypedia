  Problem statement. A concise statement of the problem your project is trying to solve.
  P1 Requirement analysis. This section should contain the report for this assignment, with three subsections:
  0. Summary of user observations and interviews – summarize your finding and conclusions from observing and talking to potential users. Remember - don't identify the users you interviewed by name, unless you get their permission to do so.
  1. Users. Your user analysis from this assignment, describing your major user classes and their characteristics. A summary of the interviews, and a persona for each user class.
  2. Tasks. Provide a summary of the 5 (or more) high-level tasks you have identified.
  Every task should have a goal and subtasks. Some tasks may also need preconditions, exceptions, time constraints, and frequency of use.
  In addition, present a hierarchical task diagram that shows the decomposition of each task to subtasks.
  3. Domain. An ERD model that describes your domain.
  Include commentary about any entities or relations that aren't obvious.

  <h3> Problem statement </h3>
  <p> Because Wellesley boasts a diverse community,
    we acknowledge that incoming students will come
    in with varying backgrounds on social and political topics.
    However, the community right now doesn’t have a platform specifically
    geared towards proliferating information, without those asking questions
    feeling attacked for being ignorant, and without those answering questions
    feeling like they are expending emotional labor. Additionally, there is no
    condensed base for all the language used when having social justice conversations,
    which can be problematic and elitist.
 </p>

 <h3> 0. Summary of user observations and interviews </h3>

  <h3> 1. Users. </h3>
    <p> Wellesley students and faculty seeking to learn about or educate
      others on political and social justice knowledge and terminology
      relevant to Wellesley College. Since our app is available to both
      Wellesley students and faculty, our target group is a rather large one,
      with the majority being 18 to 22-year-olds (college students) who use
      their smartphones and laptops on a daily basis.</p>

    <p> We created personas (listed below) in quick visualizations; more extensive descriptions
       are provided below these images </p>
  <div id = "images">

 <p>
   <strong> Persona 1: </strong> Sally is an upper middle class Caucasian 18-year-old
   first year from Minnesota with little to no knowledge
   or experience talking about social justice issues.
   She plans to be pre-med and double majoring in Biology
   and English, and hopes to be a pediatrician one day
   just like her mom. Sally is in the Pre-Med Society
   and the Botanistas. She wants to tea for a society
   next year and is applying to be an RA. She loves to
   travel to Europe for family vacations and read Jane
   Austen novels. She is fairly savvy and uses her iPhone
   7 and Macbook Pro on a daily basis for schoolwork and
   social media. Since entering Wellesley, she has found
   that she does not know a lot of appropriate terminology or
   how to engage in political or identity dialogue. </p>
   <p> <strong> Persona 2: </strong> Chad is a tenured Wellesley American Studies professor
     in his late sixties. He is a Latinx male from Cambridge,
     Massachusetts, where he resides with his partner (a Harvard professor)
     and daschund named Selena. He is very knowledgable on civil rights,
     gay and trans rights, and Chicano history. He is known amongst students
     for his classes on 1900s Latinx popular culture and music. He is progressive
     but does not engage in many contemporary discussions on social justice.
     Chad is an expert in Chicano studies but has not has the chance to engage in
     other discussions, especially with young people besides his students.
     The only technology that Chad interacts with is Gmail and Google Drive to
     send emails and documents to his students; occasionally he tries to struggle
     with Sakai (in vain). Chad goes to local concerts on the weekends and takes
     walks by the Charles with his partner and dog. Chad wears glasses. </p>
  <p> <strong> Persona 3: </strong> Sam is an extroverted, queer black 22-year-old senior studying Women
    and Gender Studies with a minor in Comparative Race and Ethnicity.
    They are a Mellon Mays Fellow, intending to get their Ph.d in
    Women and Gender studies, with an emphasis on Black Feminist
    philosophy. They’re currently writing their thesis on Assata Shakur and Angela Y.
    Davis. Sam works at Cafe Hoop and volunteers for local organizing groups in
    Boston and the Black Lives Matter chapter. They are extremely busy and do not
    have much spare time, but use the little free time they have to run a personal
    commentary blog. They are very tech savvy and uses technology as a platform to
    propagate their own knowledge and to organize events. </p>
  <p> <strong> Persona 4: </strong> Grace is an introverted 20-year-old sophomore
    who studies Psychology at Wellesley, and is from Tokyo but was born
    in Los Angeles, California. She lives on East Side and spends most of
    her time in the Science Center or hanging out with her small group of friends
    in her room. She watches Netflix and dramas in her free time, and is not
    involved in any organizations on campus. She has a working knowledge of
    political and social terminology and is aware of current political and social
    justice issues, but is not interested in exploring such topics in depth.
    She would, however, like to be more familiar with and passively engage in
    terminology and topics relevant to Wellesley, so as to not come be ignorant
    amongst her peers. She plans to find a job right after graduation. She does
    not have social media but uses her Android phone to text and her Lenovo
    Thinkpad for homework. She is fluent in Japanese and is learning Spanish at Wellesley.</p>
