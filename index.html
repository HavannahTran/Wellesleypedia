  Problem statement. A concise statement of the problem your project is trying to solve.
  P1 Requirement analysis. This section should contain the report for this assignment, with three subsections:
  0. Summary of user observations and interviews – summarize your finding and conclusions from observing and talking to potential users. Remember - don't identify the users you interviewed by name, unless you get their permission to do so.
  1. Users. Your user analysis from this assignment, describing your major user classes and their characteristics. A summary of the interviews, and a persona for each user class.
  2. Tasks. Provide a summary of the 5 (or more) high-level tasks you have identified.
  Every task should have a goal and subtasks. Some tasks may also need preconditions, exceptions, time constraints, and frequency of use.
  In addition, present a hierarchical task diagram that shows the decomposition of each task to subtasks.
  3. Domain. An ERD model that describes your domain.
  Include commentary about any entities or relations that aren't obvious.

  <h3> Problem statement </h3>
  <p> Because Wellesley boasts a diverse community,
    we acknowledge that incoming students will come
    in with varying backgrounds on social and political topics.
    However, the community right now doesn’t have a platform specifically
    geared towards proliferating information, without those asking questions
    feeling attacked for being ignorant, and without those answering questions
    feeling like they are expending emotional labor. Additionally, there is no
    condensed base for all the language used when having social justice conversations,
    which can be problematic and elitist.
 </p>

 <h3> 0. Summary of user observations and interviews </h3>

  <h3> 1. Users. </h3>
    <p> Wellesley students and faculty seeking to learn about or educate
      others on political and social justice knowledge and terminology
      relevant to Wellesley College. Since our app is available to both
      Wellesley students and faculty, our target group is a rather large one,
      with the majority being 18 to 22-year-olds (college students) who use
      their smartphones and laptops on a daily basis.</p>

    <p> We created personas (listed below) in quick visualizations; more extensive descriptions
       are provided below these images </p>
  <div id = "images">
    <img src ="Sally.png" class = "vis" alt= "visualization of persona text" style= "width:45%">
    <img src ="Chad.png" class = "vis" alt= "visualization of persona text" style= "width:45%">
    <img src ="Sam.png" class = "vis" alt= "visualization of persona text" style= "width:45%">
    <img src ="Grace.png" class = "vis" alt= "visualization of persona text" style= "width:45%">
  </div>

 <p>
   <strong> Persona 1: </strong> Sally is an upper middle class Caucasian 18-year-old
   first year from Minnesota with little to no knowledge
   or experience talking about social justice issues.
   She plans to be pre-med and double majoring in Biology
   and English, and hopes to be a pediatrician one day
   just like her mom. Sally is in the Pre-Med Society
   and the Botanistas. She wants to tea for a society
   next year and is applying to be an RA. She loves to
   travel to Europe for family vacations and read Jane
   Austen novels. She is fairly savvy and uses her iPhone
   7 and Macbook Pro on a daily basis for schoolwork and
   social media. Since entering Wellesley, she has found
   that she does not know a lot of appropriate terminology or
   how to engage in political or identity dialogue. </p>
   <p> <strong> Persona 2: </strong> Chad is a tenured Wellesley American Studies professor
     in his late sixties. He is a Latinx male from Cambridge,
     Massachusetts, where he resides with his partner (a Harvard professor)
     and daschund named Selena. He is very knowledgable on civil rights,
     gay and trans rights, and Chicano history. He is known amongst students
     for his classes on 1900s Latinx popular culture and music. He is progressive
     but does not engage in many contemporary discussions on social justice.
     Chad is an expert in Chicano studies but has not has the chance to engage in
     other discussions, especially with young people besides his students.
     The only technology that Chad interacts with is Gmail and Google Drive to
     send emails and documents to his students; occasionally he tries to struggle
     with Sakai (in vain). Chad goes to local concerts on the weekends and takes
     walks by the Charles with his partner and dog. Chad wears glasses. </p>
  <p> <strong> Persona 3: </strong> Sam is an extroverted, queer black 22-year-old senior studying Women
    and Gender Studies with a minor in Comparative Race and Ethnicity.
    They are a Mellon Mays Fellow, intending to get their Ph.d in
    Women and Gender studies, with an emphasis on Black Feminist
    philosophy. They’re currently writing their thesis on Assata Shakur and Angela Y.
    Davis. Sam works at Cafe Hoop and volunteers for local organizing groups in
    Boston and the Black Lives Matter chapter. They are extremely busy and do not
    have much spare time, but use the little free time they have to run a personal
    commentary blog. They are very tech savvy and uses technology as a platform to
    propagate their own knowledge and to organize events. </p>
  <p> <strong> Persona 4: </strong> Grace is an introverted 20-year-old sophomore
    who studies Psychology at Wellesley, and is from Tokyo but was born
    in Los Angeles, California. She lives on East Side and spends most of
    her time in the Science Center or hanging out with her small group of friends
    in her room. She watches Netflix and dramas in her free time, and is not
    involved in any organizations on campus. She has a working knowledge of
    political and social terminology and is aware of current political and social
    justice issues, but is not interested in exploring such topics in depth.
    She would, however, like to be more familiar with and passively engage in
    terminology and topics relevant to Wellesley, so as to not come be ignorant
    amongst her peers. She plans to find a job right after graduation. She does
    not have social media but uses her Android phone to text and her Lenovo
    Thinkpad for homework. She is fluent in Japanese and is learning Spanish at Wellesley.</p>

  <h3> Tasks </h3>
  <p> We decided that there were three tasks in which users would have to do to use our app:
  make an account, contribute a question, and contribute an answer.</p>
  <p> Manage an Account</p>

  <h3> Scenarios </h3>
  <p><strong> Clueless Sally (first year, inexperienced but eager) </strong></p>
  <p>  Sally is in her Africana Studies class discussing the dynamics of the Harlem Renaissance.
    While she believes that the Harlem Renaissance served all communities, a classmate of
    hers brings up the point that the literary and artistic movement suffered from “elitism”.
    Sally sits quietly in class as the discourse continues, quickly jotting down the words on
    her notes, not wanting to disrupt the discussion by asking what these terms are. After
    class, Sally pulls out her mobile device and searches in her Wellesley-pedia app for
    the terms. No existing articles or forums pop up. She creates a new question: “What is
    elitism?” Within minutes, other users have posed some answers to her question. She scrolls
    through the replies, getting a general sense of what the term implies: when those in
    privileged situations use elevate speech, vernacular, mannerisms, etc. to implicitly
    exclude those less fortunate.
  </p>
  <p></p> <!-- for a space between scenarios -->
  <p><strong> Professor Chad (professor, knowledgeable) </strong></p>
  <p>  Chad is teaching a course on Latinx popular culture;
    the course has 15 students. He notices one of his
    students does not speak up in class at all, despite
    the fact that participation is part of the student’s
    grade in the course. He invites them to office hours.
    This student reveals that they struggle to keep up with
    the concepts in class and are very introverted.
    They feel as if the way the class is taught does not engage them
    specifically. Chad acknowledges this, and tries to think of other
    ways of engaging with this student that does not make the student
    uncomfortable. The student mentions that they use the Wellesley-pedia
    app to clarify unclear concepts in class. Chad pulls up the application
    and sees if there are any forums/articles based on Latinx culture.
    He answers as many questions as possible.
  </p>
  <p></p> <!-- for a space between scenarios -->
  <p><strong> Educator Sam (senior, very involved) </strong></p>
  <p>  Sam is working their Hoop shift and overhears a table of students
    discussing Black Lives Matter while eating nachos. Sam can’t help but notice
    that some of what the students are discussing about AAVE is problematic and
    uninformed. Sam does not have the opportunity to confront them but wishes they
    could do something to educate the Wellesley community on AAVE. After Sam’s shift is
    over, they quickly pull out their phone and open the Wellesley-pedia app. They click on
    the BLM section and scrolls through the newest questions, one of which is: “Why can’t
    non-black POC use AAVE?” Sam clicks on that question and notices that there are two existing
    answers. One answer says, “anyone can use AAVE, slang is not part of racial identity.” Sam
    downvotes that answer and adds their own. Sam clicks on the add answer option, turns the
    anonymous option off (Sam wants Wellesley students to know that they are a resource on campus),
    and types in an answer. Sam also adds in their answer that the Wellesley-pedia BLM archive has
    a section covering AAVE for reference. After Sam answers, they go on the archive to check what
    the existing AAVE information is.

  <p><strong> Passive Grace (sophomore, passive) </strong></p>
  <p>  After her Psych midterm, Grace is spending her time watching Netflix.
    While watching, she comes across a term, “white privilege,” which she
    isn’t aware of. Although she is aware of the sensitivity the term associates,
    she never really delved into the issue. She reads newspaper headlines from her
    Android Phone to keep up with the news, but she doesn’t have social media to discuss
    about it or to understand how other students at Wellesley perceive the term. She doesn’t
    know who to ask and isn’t comfortable discussing the topic with other students she doesn’t
    know. Instead, she opens her Wellesley-pedia app. She finds that there are current discussions
    on “white privilege,” so she scrolls through the answers and anonymously up-votes the best
    explanation she feels was helpful. She is satisfied with the information the app provided
    her and hopes to continue using the app in the future.

  <h3> Briefing </h3>
  <p>Because Wellesley boasts a diverse community, we acknowledge that incoming students will come in with varying backgrounds on social and political topics. However, the community right now doesn’t have a platform specifically geared towards proliferating information, without those asking questions feeling attacked for being ignorant, and without those answering questions feeling like they are expending emotional labor. Additionally, there is no condensed base for all the language used when having social justice conversations, which can be problematic and elitist. Wellesleypedia is our solution to this issue: a crowd-sourced moderated forum. This forum is an open place for diverse opinions on a range of political and social justice topics.  There is a current question-answer feed as well as an archive with verified past questions and answers.
</p>

<h3> Scenario Tasks </h3>
<ul>
<li> Scenario Task 1: Ask a question about Elitism </li>
<li> Scenario Task 2: Search for white privilege question/answers and upvote a good answer </li>
<li> Scenario Task 3: Answer a question about colonialism</li>
</ul>

<h3> Observations </h3>
<h4>Pilot Run</h4>
<p>Scenario Task 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two out of three of the pilot users skipped the “search” prototype screens we had and directly asked a question about Elitism. Pilot User 2 searched for “elitism” in the search bar and was notified that there were no existing questions. All three users clicked the plus button on the top right corner of the screen to ask a new question. Pilot User 2 was confused by the “anonymous?” popup setup of the question submission.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scenario Task 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot User 1 had trouble with the steps and did not know what to click; she also read over the prompted question whenever she was confused. With help, she was able to navigate the task. Pilot User 2 searched for “white privilege,” saw the related question and clicked on it, then saw the answers and upvoted one by clicking the thumbs up icon. She said that it was very intuitive. Pilot User 3 went through a series of similar steps, but was briefly confused as to whether the newsfeed shows questions or answers upon searching for “white privilege.”
</li>
</ul>

<p>Scenario Task 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>All three pilot users were confused by a lack of screen for typing in an answer and submitting it. Pilot User 1 did not know whether or not to click anywhere in the question boxes in the newsfeed to expand them. Pilot User 2 and Pilot User 3 immediately clicked on the existing colonialism question in the newsfeed to expand it, then tried to submit answers. We realized that a usability problem was that we were lacking crucial screens; we needed screens for the user to type in their answer to a question and submit it.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Real User Run</h4>
<p>Scenario Task 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>User 1 searched up elitism in the top search bar, found no existing topics, and pressed the plus button on the upper right corner of the screen to post a question on elitism. She did not have any problems. User 2 followed similar, smooth steps, noting that the plus sign was intuitive. User 2 took a while to find the tag bar (thought it was a bit small and wasn’t sure what it was for) before pressing submit. User 3 did not know which symbol to click on to ask a new question and wished that the “ask new question” button was somewhere else on the screen. All three users used all of the prototype screens and searched up “elitism” before posting a question, achieving all of the task goals.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Scenario Task 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the real users smoothly accomplished the task with no major issues; they searched up white privilege in the search bar, then clicked on the resulting white privilege question. They then upvoted an answer by clicking the thumbs up, causing the thumbs up icon to turn a different color. User 2 noted that the plus button for asking a new question’s placement right next to the search bar made her briefly think that it was the button for submitting a search query.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Scenario Task 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the users successfully accomplished this task with our updated prototype screens. The three users noticed the “what is colonialism” question existing in the newsfeed screen, clicked on it to expand it, clicked “type an answer”, chose whether or not to be anonymous, and submitted their answer. Users 1 and 2 chose to be anonymous, while User 3 chose not to be. User 1 observed that she thought she would automatically type the answer into the “type answer” bar, but that there was a popup instead.
</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3> Prototype Iteration </h3>
<p>The issues the pilot users addressed for task 2 influenced our changes in the prototype design. The lack of screen for typing in an answer confused the pilot users, so we created a new pop up that allows the user to write his or her answer in the text box. Pilot User 2 was confused by the ‘anonymous’ pop up set up that we decided to combine the anonymous feature and text box in one pop up screen (as shown in the image below). Since all the features are in one screen, it reduced the number of screens the user encountered with. Furthermore, the ‘Answer a Question’ pop up screen is consistent with the ‘Ask a Question’ popup screen in task 1, because inconsistency can become another confusing factor in our design. After learning how even pilot users with a further understanding of our app and the general use of prototypes had a confusion with the task, we aimed to take extra attention to each design we implemented. Reducing the number of screens reflects how our design should be economical, but also effective by combining all the features into one screen.

<h3> Resolutions</h3>
<p>
We learned that different users have different needs and usability desires. While some users found certain buttons confusing, others found the same buttons intuitive. However, there were overwhelming problems we found, such as confusion over what certain buttons were used for due to lack of text (we use icons to represent pages and actions in our app). A possible solution for this usability issue is to have a “help” screen (represented by a question mark icon) that guides the user through the different aspects and uses of the app. We could also have a tutorial that demonstrates the different features of the app when the user first signs up.
